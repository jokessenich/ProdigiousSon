        <h1> About the Author</h1>

        <p>Ralph “Corky” Matson was born in Chicago, Illinois on March 10,1943. With only one year of high school under his belt, he managed to graduate from the Kellberg Institute of Swedish Massage, the Dale Carnegie Institute for Public Speaking and mentored Rolfing with Daniel Blake. His lifelong desire to help others and put aside material attainments in the pursuit of spiritual experiences allowed him to balance his darker side—addiction to drugs, alcohol and gambling. When focusing his attention on his positive and spiritual nature, he was blessed with extraordinary experiences and meetings with remarkable people. His spiritual mentors were Ram Dass, Dr. Rammurti S. Mishra, Swami Rama, Margaret Coble, Patricia Cota Robles and Elias DeMohan. With a life that constantly pitted him between darkness and light he managed to survive several brushes with imminent death. On the way to the emergency room, struck down with severe heart failure, his nephew John pleaded with him to write his memoir, telling him "Corky, you cannot die until you have told your story." From that inspiration this book was born.
