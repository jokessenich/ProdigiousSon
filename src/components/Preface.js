        <h3>By John Kessenich</h3>

        <p className = "preface-p">Since I was a child, I remember being around Corky and feeling a sense of magic in the air. I didn’t get to see him often, except at family reunions and special occasions, as he lived on the other side of the country from me. Although I didn’t see him often, he always had an unwavering support of and enthusiasm for my passions (usually being a catcher for me while I would try to throw curveballs for hours). In the evenings he would regale myself and my family with stories from his extraordinary life. It seemed to me that he lived in a different world, one where people had no limits and anything was possible.
{<br />}{<br />}During my college years I started doing my own deep personal spiritual exploration and Corky was always there as a guiding light. He was not hindered by restrictions and there was nothing taboo, nothing off limits. His  ability to understand and empowered demeanor were critical in helping me navigate my way through life. life. One of
these occasions was after I graduated from college and became the caretaker for my mother as she
struggled with cancer. Corky was a tremendous support for both of us. His wise counsel about the importance of inner work assisted me while I went through the heavy outer work of facing loss.
{<br />}{<br />}
In 2013, my mom died and I was faced with the numbness of an empty world. My mother had been my spiritual teacher and our relationship was the closest of my life. I no longer had her to care for, nor her loving guidance to follow. Naturally, I turned to Corky as my new spiritual teacher and although he shrugged off the idea of being my mentor multiple times, we continued our spiritual work and connection with deep discussions from afar. 
A year later I quit my job, and as I dug through my mind, body and soul, searching for my own purpose and deep desires, I found little. The only thing I knew was that I wanted to go on a long journey, and that I had to be alone. The only appropriate send off that I could see was to visit Corky in Colorado. We had planned to go down to Ojo Caliente and have a long soak in the hot springs. Unfortunately, due to a bout with food poisoning prior to my visit, Corky was not in good health and unable to make the trip. I decided to go to his house for a few days instead.
{<br />}{<br />}
During that visit it was clear that he was worn out, lacked motivation and didn’t have his normal energy. However, his stories and the magic of his soul were still in abundance. I had met many amazing people in my life, but I had never met anyone like Corky. Successful people, funny people, spiritual people, any people… I had never seen someone truly alive in the way that Corky was. And I knew that’s what I wanted--the experience of being truly alive. Seeing the condition that he was in, it narrowly crept across my mind that he might have some serious health issues, and that I should finally start capturing some of the stories that had dazzled me for so many years.
I immediately went to the store, bought a voice recorder and the next day we started cataloging his stories, beginning with the introduction to what would eventually be his memoir. Our plan was to meet up next spring to continue recording stories when I returned from my journeys.
{<br />}{<br />}
I traveled to Europe, the Middle East, India, Southeast Asia and New Zealand, spreading my mom’s ashes along the way. In New Zealand, a few weeks before my flight back to the US, I received an ominous phone message from Corky where he sounded absolutely ragged. He said, “John I’m not sure if we’re going to be able to finish the book. I haven’t been sleeping well and my breathing is getting incredibly troubled.”
Receiving that call, my heart sank. I immediately changed my plane ticket and the next day I was on my way to Colorado Springs. That was a long day of travel with some very interesting synchronistic events, which ended with Corky picking me up at the Colorado Springs airport at about 11PM. That night I slept on a little mattress on the floor that he had lovingly put out for me. The next morning I woke up leisurely, tired from my travels and went to the kitchen of his small mobile home. Corky was sitting at the kitchen table and said, “I think you need to take me to the emergency room.” 
{<br />}{<br />}
At the ER, the doctors heavily delivered the news of his failing heart. At that point he was feeling like he might not ever go back home, that he would die in the hospital. I told him, “You can’t die, you have to write your story first.” 
I brought the recorder to the hospital everyday and recorded stories while he was awake. The doctors drained fluid from his lungs and insisted that he have a major heart surgery, but released him to go back home once his breathing improved . His heart was still troubled, but he slept better and therefore had more energy to tell stories during the day. I spent the next month and a half recording his stories when he had the strength, but we were both aware his heart was still problematic. Our intention was to get these recordings transcribed so it could be put into a book, and I was determined to transcribe every word. I lived with Corky on and off for about a year, listening to his stories and soaking in his wisdom.
{<br />}{<br />}
The transcription process was a minefield for me. I was faced with the decision of whether I was actually going to write everything that Corky said verbatim, or if I would filter it through my lens, or give it to an editor. I imagined that I would share this with my future children and grandchildren and wanted to keep all of Corky’s stories intact. I wanted to keep the magic and life that I felt in Corky’s spirit. So I kept everything exactly in his voice, every stutter, every repetition, every sentence that was half-finished. It is not a literary piece of art, it is a piece of humanity. 
In re-reading the book, I asked Corky (and myself) if we should change things to make the book more “conventional” or “literary.” A friend of his had called the book “raw” and “unvarnished.” I loved that, and still do. We decided to edit only typos I had made  and things that absolutely did not make sense. This led to a less refined literary style but, in my mind, a real piece of Ralph “Corky” Matson.
